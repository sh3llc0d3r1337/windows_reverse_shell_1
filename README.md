The Cpp source
Before we can use the socket library and call any of its function, we have to call the WSAStartup function. This initializes the socket library.

We can execute cmd.exe with calling CreateProcess.

STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW is necessary to hide the command window of cmd.exe.

Streams can be redirected with specifying the STARTF_USESTDHANDLES flag and setting the hStdâ€¦ members of the STARTUPINFO to the socket handle.
